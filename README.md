Django Email as Username
========================

**User authentication with email addresses instead of usernames.**

**Author:** Tom Christie, [@_tomchristie][1].

**See also:** [django-email-login][2], [django-email-usernames][3].

Overview
========

Allows you to treat users as having only email addresses, instead of usernames.

1. Provides an email auth backend and helper functions for creating users.
2. Patches the Django admin to handle email based user authentication.
3. Overides the `createsuperuser` command to create users with email only.
4. Treats email authentication as case-insensitive.

Installation
============

Install from PyPI:

    pip install django-email-as-username

Add 'emailusernames' to INSTALLED_APPS.

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'emailusernames',
    )

Set `EmailAuthBackend` as your authentication backend:

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        'emailusernames.backends.EmailAuthBackend',
    )

Usage
=====

Creating users
--------------

You should create users using the `create_user` and `create_superuser`
functions.

    from emailusernames.utils import create_user, create_superuser

    create_user('me@example.com', 'password')
    create_superuser('admin@example.com', 'password')

Retrieving users
----------------

You can retrieve users, using case-insensitive email matching, with the
`get_user` function.  Similarly you can use `user_exists` to test if a given
user exists.

    from emailusernames.utils import get_user, user_exists

    user = get_user('someone@example.com')
    ...

    if user_exists('someone@example.com'):
        ...

Updating users
--------------

You can update a user's email and save the instance, without having to also modify the username.

    user.email = 'other@example.com'
    user.save()

Note that the `user.username` attribute will always return the email address, but behind the scenes it will be stored as a hashed version of the user's email.

User Forms
----------

`emailusernames` provides the following forms that you can use for authenticating, creating and updating users:

* `emailusernames.forms.EmailAuthenticationForm`
* `emailusernames.forms.EmailAdminAuthenticationForm`
* `emailusernames.forms.UserCreationForm`
* `emailusernames.forms.UserChangeForm`
